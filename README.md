- You are my favorite hello and hardest goodbye. 
- Meeting you is the happiest thing in life.
- We believe small actions today that could make bigger difference tomorrow.

- Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react it.
- (人生是 10% 發生在你身上的事，90% 你的反應)

- 先努力優秀，再大方擁有。所謂生活，有所為，有所愛，有所期待。
- 不謀全局者，不足謀一城。有所想，有所為。
- 好讀書，不求甚解；每有會意，便欣然忘食。
- 本性決定行為，本性取決於行為。
- 清空你的杯子，方能再行注滿，空無以求全。
